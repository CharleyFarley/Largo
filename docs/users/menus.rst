Available Menu Areas
--------------------

The Largo theme has five customizable menu areas:

**Global Navigation** - The links in the dark gray bar at the very top of the page. When viewed on a small screen such as a mobile device, this menu collapses and appears in a dropdown menu instead. The name of the menu area can be changed under Appearance > Menus to set the top level target for the dropdown menu on small screens. Note that you do not have to use this area at all if you do not wish to, but it can be a good place to put supplemental links such as links to your about or contact page or links to login or register (if relevant for your site)

**Main Navigation** - The main site navigation that appears in the menu bar nav. By default the main navigation is displayed just below the header when viewed on a desktop computer. When viewed on a mobile device (with a screen size of 768px or less) the main navigation becomes sticky at the top of the screen. The sticky nav disappears when the user scrolls down, and reappears when scrolling up. You can also choose in Appearance > Theme Options > Navigation to enable the sticky navigation for all screen sizes on article pages, and optionally to hide the header and display only the sticky nav on article pages.

**Don't Miss** - An optional menu area that you must enable and configure under Appearance > Theme Options before it will appear on your site (it is hidden by default). This is a good place to link to category, tag or series pages that you want to highlight for your readers but not necessarily include in the main navbar.

**Footer Navigation** - This menu area appears in the left column of the site footer and could mirror some of the navigation items in the header area or provide supplemental links to items such as your jobs page, ethics policy, or other items that might commonly appear in a website footer.

**Footer Bottom** - A menu area that appears at the very bottom of the footer and should be used to link to things like your site's terms of service, privacy policy or other legal information that should appear with the copyright notice in the site footer.

Deprecated Menu Areas
---------------------

**Navbar Categories List** (removed in version 0.4) - This menu populates the main navigation bar with your site's primary content categories. When viewed on a small screen, this area will be collapsed into a dropdown menu. Note that this is the only menu area that supports a multi-level menu (child categories will be displayed as dropdown menus up to two levels deep, but only the parent categories will be displayed on mobile devices).

**Navbar Supplemental Links** (removed in version 0.4) - This is another optional menu area that allows you to add additional link to the main navbar. This menu will always appear to the right of the Navbar Categories List items and collapses into a dropdown menu when viewed on small screen sizes.

NOTE: If you were previously using these menu areas the update script for version 0.4 will consolidate them into the Main Navigation menu area described above.
