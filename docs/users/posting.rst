Writing Posts
=============


After you have entered the text for your post you are able to create asides and pull quotes as well as add media to your post.

Module Wrapper
--------------

Within in the body copy box, using the visual editor you can access the module wrapper options by clicking on the icon furthest to the right.

The module wrapper enables you to make a selection of text appear as an aside or a pull out quote.

Add Media
---------

The default Standard Layout template (One Column) enables you to highlight an image or gallery in the large "hero" section at the top of the post by adding them through the Add Media button.


Featured Media
--------------

The Set Featured Media button is located above the body copy box.

In this window you can select featured media:  embed code, video, image or gallery of images to appear in the hero section at the top of the article.
The featured media may also appear on the homepage (see Post Prominence below).


After you are finished with the body of the post, there are a number of additional options to consider.


On the right sidebar of the Post Edit Screen you will find:

**Categories and Tags**

Categories and tags are used to organize content on your site.

Additional Options

Show related posts that are either editorially determined (by adding related post IDs in the Additional Options box of the post edit screen) or using a default related algorithm that tries to surface the most closely-related post(s) to a given post by series, category or tag.

To override the default related posts functionality enter specific related post IDs separated by commas.

To find the post id, from the post menu, click on the post you are looking to identify.

The Post ID  is 1280.

**Top Term**

From a pulldown menu (populated by categories and tags) Identify which of the post's terms is primary.
