**Child Themes:** A child theme enables you to make customizations that are unique to your site, see [[Creating Child Themes]] 

**Post Prominence:** Used to determine which posts to display on the homepage or in featured posts widgets in the sidebar and footer. You might also add additional categories to this taxonomy to create custom feeds for distribution to content partners. For more information, see [[Taxonomies]].

**Post Types:** Post types are a way of labeling posts with a particular type, such as "Data reporting" or "Transcripts." Each post type can have an icon, which will be used in certain places in the theme. Each post type also has its own archive. For more information, see [[Taxonomies]] and [[Post Templates]].

**Series:** A collection of related posts, arranged chronologically. See [[Series Landing Pages]] for more information.

**Tags:** Keywords or topics used to group related posts together on a more micro level. For example, you might have a category called "Politics" and posts in that category might have tags like "Campaign Finance", "Election 2012", etc.

**Taxonomy:** a way to label and organize the posts on your site. See [[Taxonomies]].

**Widget:** A self-contained piece of content, static or dynamic, that can be placed in any number of pre-defined widget areas called Sidebars. Widgets are configured in the WordPress Dashboard under **Appearance > Widgets**. 

**Sidebar:** A pre-defined area where widgets can be placed. Despite what the name may suggest, a sidebar is not necessarily a bar that appears on the left or right side, although that is a common place for them. Sidebars may appear anywhere on the page, as long as it's defined as such in the PHP code. Sidebars can have widgets added to them in the WordPress Dashboard under **Appearance > Widgets**.
