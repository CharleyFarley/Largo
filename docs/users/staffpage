# Staff roster shortcode

In its simplest form, a staff roster shortcode looks like:

    [roster]

However, it has several optional attributes which can control which users appear in the roster.

You can set:

## `roles`

By default, the `roster` shortcode includes only users with the "author" role.

To specify which WordPress roles should be included use comma-separated values like so:

    [roster roles="administrator,author,editor"]

All possible values for the `roles` attribute:

- administrator
- author
- editor
- contributor
- subscriber

## `exclude`

Use this attribute to exclude users by ID. For example, say you have a user called "Largo Project Administrator" which has an "administrator" role. Let's say that user's ID is 2. Here's how you would exclude that user from the staff roster:

    [roster roles="administrator,author,editor" exclude="2"]

To exclude more than one user, use comma-separated values. For example:

    [roster roles="administrator,author,editor" exclude="2,32,56"]

## `include`

Similarly, you can specifically include users with the `include` attribute. If you wanted to ommit all "administrator" users except "Largo Project Administrator" your `roster` shortcode would look like:

    [roster roles="author,editor" include="2"]

## `show_users_with_empty_desc`

By default, the `roster` shortcode does not include users with an empty bio/description. If you want to show users with an empty bio/description anyway, add the attribute `show_users_with_empty_desc` to the `roster` shortcode like so:

    [roster roles="administrator,author,editor" exclude="2" show_users_with_empty_desc]
