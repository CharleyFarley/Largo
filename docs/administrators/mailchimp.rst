Connecting Mailchimp
====================

This document will describe how to connect your Largo instance to an automated `Mailchimp`_ newsletter.

There are a number of options to customize and automate mailings using the custom RSS feed template built into Largo to integrate seamlessly with MailChimp's RSS to email functionality.

If you want to learn more here are two how-to resources from MailChimp that explain the process:

`Create an RSS-Driven Campaign <http://kb.mailchimp.com/campaigns/rss-in-campaigns/create-an-rss-driven-campaign>`_

`RSS-to-Email <http://mailchimp.com/features/rss-to-email/>`_

And to see an example of the Largo to MailChimp integration in action, check out the newsletters from `Aspen Journalism <http://aspenjournalism.org/>`_ or `Yellowstone Gate <http://www.yellowstonegate.com/>`_
