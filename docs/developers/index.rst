For Developers
==============

Overview
--------

Project Largo is released as open source software and anyone is welcome to `download or fork the project from our github repository <https://github.com/INN/Largo>`_ and use it as they like.

If you use Largo for a project `we'd love to hear from you <mailto:largo@inn.org>`_ so can we add you to our list of sites using Largo and help get the word out.

The preferred way of building a site with Largo is by creating a WordPress child theme. We have created a `sample, heavily documented, child theme <childthemes.html#advanced-theme-development-and-modification>`_ to help you understand the way we structure our child themes in the hopes that it will give you a solid framework to get started. There is more information on setting up Largo and `using child themes <../users/download.html#creating-child-themes>`_ in the download and installation section of our documentation.

Child Themes
------------

What *is* a child theme?
`````````````````````

From the `WordPress Codex <http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes>`_:

  A child theme is a theme that inherits the functionality and styling of another theme, called the parent theme. Child themes are the recommended way of modifying an existing theme.
