# Largo Docs

Documentation in this directory is written in [reStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html), compiled to html by [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/) and hosted in its final form at [largo.readthedocs.org](http://largo.readthedocs.org/).

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/largo/badge/?version=develop)](https://readthedocs.org/projects/largo/?badge=develop)

### Contributing

We'd love your help!!! We host the documentation with the code so it's as simple as possible to get started. Editing the docs is a three step process:

1. Edit the .rst files in the `docs/` folder.
2. Compile these changes locally to check the work.
3. Issue a pull request for us to merge in.

##### Compiling.

We've built wrappers around the sphinx compilation process to make it easy to use.

###### 1. Use our development tools:

If you're already using our development tools, running:

	$ fab dev assets.watch

will compile .html documentation when *.rst files are saved.

The HTML files will be saved in `docs/_build/html`.

###### 2. Using grunt directly:

In a new terminal window install the python dependencies in `docs/`

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

_(If you do not have pip installed, you can install it with _`sudo easy_install pip`_. Requirements may be installed in a python [virtualenv](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/).)_

Now to compile docs run:

	$ grunt docs

To have grunt watch for changes and compile automatically, you can run:

	$ grunt watch

The HTML files will be saved in `docs/_build/html`.

### Autogenerated PHP Docblocks

PHP files may be compiled from `.php > .json > .rst` using [doxphp](https://github.com/avalanche123/doxphp). More documentation to come.
